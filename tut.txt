# REST: Representational State Transfer 
    REST is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services

# CRUD operations:
    Get, Post, Put, Patch, Delete

# Implementation
    GET -> /posts -> to get data for all posts [index route]
    
    POST -> /posts -> to add a new post [create route]
        2 routes: serve the form -> GET -> /posts/new
                  add the new post -> POST -> /posts

    GET -> /posts/:id -> to get one post(using id) [show route]

    PATCH -> /posts/:id -> to update specific post [update route]

    GET -> /posts/:id/edit -> Serve the edit form [Edit route]

    DELETE -> /posts/:id -> to delete specific post [Destroy route]

# Redirect : res.redirect(url)

# Creating Id's: UUID Package -> npm i uuid
    built in : crypto.randomUUID() 

# Package: method-override
    using query strings method:
    
# posts.filter() -> filter method for array creates a new array with elements from an original array that pass a test implemented by a callback function
